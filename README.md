# CVWO Winter Assignment (SHRINIKET SUBRAMANIAN)

This repo contains the backend (Go) & frontend (Typescript) for my attempt of CVWO's Winter Assignment

Link to deployed application: https://cvwo-assignment-4v24.onrender.com

# Local Installation

The application runs on a PostgreSQL DB that is hosted online with a secret key for access that needs to be provided 
as a DATABASE_URI parameter in a .env file. 

To run the app, the env file should be placed at the root of the repository. The env file should have 2 parameters (DATABASE_URI & SECRET). The SECRET
parameter is used for the signing of JWT Tokens used for the purpose of authenticating the user

A build of the frontend has already been generated and can be found in the backend folder. The relative path for the env file and the build folder should 
be modified before running it locally. 

To install dependencies for the frontend: 
```console
   $ yarn install 
```

To generate a build of the frontend 
```console
   $ yarn build 
```

Copy over the build of the frontend to the backend folder
```console
   $ cp -r build ../backend
```

Run Backend Server 
```console
   $ go run cmd/server/main.go 
```

You may now open the app running on localhost:8000
Alternatively, you may skip this process and access the deployed app on: https://cvwo-assignment-4v24.onrender.com
